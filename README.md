# Compositional_data_kriging
**M.Sc. thesis topic of Matthias Van Delsen (KU Leuven)**  
"Optimal geostatistical interpolation of complete grain-size distributions for estimation of sand resources"

## Idea
Finding a more robust way to interpolate compositional data (here in the form of grain size data) by using centred log ratio (clr) transformation and principal component analysis (PCA) on the data, using ordinary kriging to interpolate them and finally reversing the PCA and clr transformation to obtain compositional data once again.

## Contents
1) Analysis: contains Jupyter notebooks with 
-	A) Berg data cleaning and EDA, 
-	B) MHZ data cleaning and EDA, 
-	C)  Pre- and Postprocessing (PPP) module,
-	D) Cross validation with MSE calculation.

Also contains local Python packages containing:
-	Data cleaning and visualisation package
-	

2) Contour maps: all interpolated grain size distributions via both methods as contour maps

3) Cross validation clr: Pre- and Postprocessed cross validation files

4) Data: Initial database as well as cleaned data

5) Docs: Initial description of project; final thesis might be added here

6) Kriging: All interpolated grid files from SurferÂ® 10 (Golden Software)

7) Results: all files resulting from Python notebooks and/or scripts

8) Scripts: Python and BASIC (Script Surfer) scripts
